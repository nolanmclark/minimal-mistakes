  Over the last few weeks I started looking into blogging and getting a head start into publishing my own findings. I've had experience with Ruby on Rails in the past, but hadn't seen the opportunity to build a fully-functional blog with it.

  With research I had come to find a Ruby gem called Jekyll. Jekyll converts a tedious process of hosting a personal blog into an easy experience by streamlining the process. Content is automatically processed and built through Jekyll into static webpages for hosting and development, perfect for any user who doesn't want to write a whole backend and front-end for a basic blog.

  So I was interested in this new Jekyll system, what could I get it to do? Combining Jekyll with Github allows your files to be uploaded to a data management system and built through GitHub. Awesome how all the processes work together right? With the successful building of a blog, I was able to edit my own personal template with HTML5 and SASS(also supported by Jekyll), for our blog home and post layout.
  Streamlined processes make for a great user experience even for developers. Jekyll and GitHub have very great UX design after you get past the initial learning curve.
  
  Keep it up Jekyll and GitHub!
