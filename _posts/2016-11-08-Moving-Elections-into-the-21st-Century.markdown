In an ever-changing, technological world, I can't see how we are still using simple paper and pencil to cast our votes for the highest office in the land. We still seem extremely hesitant on the idea of voting for an election over the internet even with all of our current advancements in technology and security. Take a second to think of how easy the process would be and how much voter participation we would bring in, including those with disabilities and those unable to get to the polls on election day. 

You enter in your name and individual license number into a secured page, select your picks for office, and submit your selections straight to a database for sorting. This counts out the possibility of voter fraud with the use of your individual license number, it also would automatically link your license to your state and local political nominees, and lastly gives you the opportunity to vote from home at anytime. But is it that simple?

In light of recent cyber attacks and the potential for major damage, I can see where one would be a little hesitant in the idea of making voting so publicly available. But someone on this planet, especially those running the United States national security, should be able to make a secured web page of this magnitude. If we can hold personal classified info such as tax documents online, why not develop a similar voting system?

Give a very simple UI with a very secured submission form, and you now have the ability to greatly increase the number of voters in the United States. Sounds easy right? I'm sure it's a lot more complicated than it seems, but at least I made you think about it! :)

Thanks for reading.
